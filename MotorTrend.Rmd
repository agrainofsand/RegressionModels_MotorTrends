#Background
Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry, is interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. “Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
2. "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

```{r echo=FALSE}
qplot(factor(am), mpg, data = mtcars, geom=c("boxplot", "jitter"))
```
